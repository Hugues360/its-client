Its typical use is to relate data used in speed warning and traction calculations for the lane segment or roadway segment in which the measurement is taken.

The defined mappings found there are used to determine when a given class is meant. The typical use of this element is to map additional movement restrictions or rights (in both the MAP and SPAT messages) to special classes of users (trucks, high sided vehicles, special vehicles etc.).
