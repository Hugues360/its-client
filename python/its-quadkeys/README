its-quadkeys
============

This Python-3.10+ package implements usefull abstractions around
quadtrees, suitable for the ITS clients.


its_quadkeys.QuadKey()
----------------------

This class implements one path in a quadtree. I.e. it represents a
n-deep branch of a quadtree. It can be represented as a sequence of
one or more of the characters in the set (0,1,2,3), like: 1332011321

The two main operations on a QuadKey are:

  * its_quadkeys.QuadKey.split(extra_depth):
    Splits the QuadKey into an extra_depth-deeper QuadZone.

  * its_quadkeys.QuadKey.neighbours():
    Returns the QuadKeys neighbouring this QuadKey.


its_quadeys.QuadZone()
----------------------

This class implements a zone made of one or more QuadKeys, and allows
manipulations on that zone.

The two main operations on a QuadZone are:

  * its_quadeys.QuadZone.optimise():
    Merge the QuadKeys defining the Zone, so as to optimise the number
    of QuadKeys defining the zone.
    When a zone is created by adding and removing QuadKeys, the definition
    for that zone can be sub-optimal, like having two QuadKeys partially
    covering the same area, of four QuadKeys that can be merged into their
    super-QuadKey. optimise() allows simplifying the zone.

  * its_quadeys.QuadZone.neighbours(depth):
    Returns a QuadZone made of the neighbouring QuadKeys of deph 'depth'.
